# FlxPedalV6-FlxMain

This is the main process running on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module. It launches FlxPedalUi, using request and response FIFOs for IPC.  It also reads combo files and processes their data into running, interconnected signal processes.

This is the 6th Version of the pedal itself.  A new version generally means a change in hardware, or a addition or removal of a linux process.
